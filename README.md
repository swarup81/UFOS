# UFOS
Create a webpage and table using HTML and javascript.

# Overview of Project: 

## Purpose:

This project aims to create a webpage and dynamic table that provides a thorough analysis of ufo sightings and allows users to filter multiple criteria simultaneously. The dynamic table can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape.

# Results:

There is a filter search box on the web page to the left of the table, and users can enter a date, city, state, country, or shape, then press the enter. The results will show according to the user's search criteria. 


The following is the example: Here i have entered san diego ,ca and us in filter search.

# Summary:

* The drawback I found in the enter city search filter is that it is case-sensitive, and we have to enter the city names precisely in the table. For instance, if I enter the city name Sandiego or SAN DIEGO, I don't get any results, but I can see the results if I add san diego.
## Recommendations:

* A Dropdown menu for search filter would be helpful to pick the date, city, state, country, and shape.
* Another recommendation is that filter search must be more user-friendly by ignoring case-sensitive and spaces between the strings.
